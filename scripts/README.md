Scripts
=======

## Overview

This folder contains scripts, programs, and examples. Some of the programs
here may be demonstrations only while others may be usable in production by a
number of users.

To contribute to community adoption of the RingCentral Ruby SDK, please add
your scripts and programs to this folder. Include a brief comment at
the beginning of your source describing what it does.

## Installation

### Install Dependencies

```
% gem install bundler
% bundle install
```

## Credentials

Many of the scripts in this folder use a `.env` file to hold application and
user credentials. To create your own file, copy the sample file
`credentials_sample.env.txt` to `.env` and add your own information.
